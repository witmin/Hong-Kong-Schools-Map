# Mapbox GL JS app in React 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The master branch used the [Hong Kong Schools location data](https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-edb-schinfo-school-location-and-information)

The branch 'province-layer-of-china' loads the map of China in the center with a layer of provinces.
